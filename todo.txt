Short-Term Goals:
    Build a method for compacting serial numbers on reminders so that when
    they build up and are sparse, they can be made reasonable again without
    deleting the whole database of them.

    Create a package for Trivial Todo and upload it to Pypi so that it may be
    run in a reasonable way, rather than ./todo.py or python todo.py

    Setup a search for relative dates, like, reminders older than a week

Long-Term Goals:
    Create GUI. Maybe. Probably not.

    Test with larger database. Optimization may be necessary.

    Make a way to import/export todos

    Build a config script to configure a few settings. Maybe.
