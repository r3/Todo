A basic reminder system for handling trivial todo notes. Created to supplant my
current system of recording such things in a ~/.todo file using a text editor.
This approach is more flexible and extendible.

This will be a command line only project for the time being. I may expand this
to a Qt GUI eventually, but I've little use for it at the moment.

For example usage, see todo.notes
