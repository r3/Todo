Trivial Todo

Description:
Trivial Todo is a basic reminder system for handling notes. It allows the user
to record notices and catagories for those notices, even due dates. You can
search your notices by content or due dates, print out all of the reminders in a
catagory, or simply print them all out. Once you've completed one of your
reminders, you can delete it.

Instructions:
    Make the file executable: chmod +x todo.py
    Read the general usage help: ./todo --help

General Use:
    todo add "Reminder contents" [--catagory whatever] [--due tomorrow]
    todo remove 2
    todo show [--catagory whatever] [--number 2]
    todo search "search" [--due tomorrow]

    For more help, try todo subcommand --help (example: todo add --help)

Incomplete Features:
    I need to allow for further time designations to be parsed. Currently, todo
    only handles things like '3 days' or '1 week' or even 'today' and
    'tomorrow', but it needs to support non-relative dates like 03/08.

                -------------------------------------------

In the future, I'll build this into a package and add features. Please feel free
to contact me and make suggestions or bug reports.
