Description:
Trivial Todo is a basic reminder system for handling notes. It allows the user
to record notices and catagories for those notices, even due dates. You can
search your notices by content or due dates, print out all of the reminders in
a catagory, or simply print them all out. Once you've completed one of your
reminders, you can delete it.

Reminders are stored using Python's shelve and pickle system in ~/.todo.shelve

Instructions:
    Make the file executable: chmod +x todo.py
    Read the general usage help: ./todo.py --help

General Use:
    todo.py add "Reminder contents" [--catagory whatever] [--due tomorrow]
    todo.py remove 2
    todo.py show [--catagory whatever] [--number 2]
    todo.py search "search" [--due tomorrow]

For more help, try todo.py subcommand --help (example: todo.py add --help)

                -------------------------------------------

In the future, I'll build this into a package and add features. Please feel
free to contact me and make suggestions or bug reports.
